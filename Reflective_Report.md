## Learning process of using Jupyter Notebooks & solving problems

- Through my weekly workshop classes and lecturtes, I was able to form a good understaning of how Jupyter Notebooks function and the ability to use Python to explore datasets in a strcutured and presentable format. The notebooks are built from a sequence of cells that can function as either a code or markdown block. I only explored these two forms of cells to structure my notebooks, using Markdown for titles, headings and text, and code blocks to input the required code.

- Having a small amount of experience with Python already, and understadning other programming languages, importing packages and using functions to perform data exploration was easy to understand. In regards to actually solving the data related questions, I found this a bit more difficult, in terms of of knowing what to look for and make sense of the data that was output after programming the solutions. Throughout the course it began to make a lot more sense.

## My progression & future endeavours

- I've definitely gained a greater understanding of data science and python programming since I started. I still feel it's more on the basic level, which doesn't concern me greatly as I am not significantly interested in data science specifically. What I enjoyed the most was learning more Python which will become applicable further in my degree as I am focusing on web and mobile development.

## Portfolio 4 Discussion

- The Portfolio 4 task gave us the opportunity to develop our own structured exploration of a dataset of our choosing. This meant that I needed to carefully develop relevant questions to test against the dataset and discover a deeper understanding of the data, by finding relationships between values and and seeing if the values stored can give some more meaningful insights.

### Choosing Uber Request Data

- After looking through the available datasets to use for this portfolio task, I ended up going with request data of Uber trips. I chose this dataset as I understood the varaibles involved and and was interested in seeing if I could discover any patterns or further understanding about where and when trips take place, etc.

### Choosing the target problem to solve

- The goal of my Portfolio 4 was to find further insight into Uber trips. Finding how many drivers were active and at what times. The duration and quantity of trips, and if there were enough drivers to keep up with the amount of requests at the time and location.

### Selecting suitable machine models

- The reason you chose the specific machine models in portfolio 4 and why these models are suitable for solving the problem you have raised.

### Conclusion drawn from the study

- The goal was to find further information about Uber trips. By the end of the data exploration I was able to find that in the dataset's timeframe, there was a greater number of cancelled or unavailable requests compared to the amount of completed trips, suggesting a possible shortage of drivers during peak demand hours.

- Furthermore, while the number of drivers who completed and cancelled trip requests was almost equal, there were more drivers who completed trips vs the amount cancelled. Interestingly, the completed, cancelled, and unavailable trips were distributed fairly evenly for the given days included in the dataset.

- The average duration of completed trips was around 52 minutes, with the busiest times for completed trips to be between 5 am and 9 am, as well as between 5 pm and 10 pm. The dataset revealed an equal distribution of drivers between the "Airport" and "City" locations. However, at the Airport location, there were fewer cancelled trips but a higher number of unavailable requests, indicating a higher demand compared to the supply of drivers. In the City, there were more completed trips, although the number of cancelled and unavailable trips was relatively even, suggesting that the supply of drivers still struggled to meet the demand, resulting in more cancelled trips. It was also discovered that trips were not cancelled during the late night and early morning hours, roughly between 10 pm and 4 am.

- To conclude, I feel the results were within expectation, given the involved locations, the peak hours makes sense and the lack of supply vs demand is understandable, seeing as how there are more people who need lifts than there are Uber drivers and with the availability of other driving services, It could be presumed that customers would be accepting the first availble option amongst the various services.
